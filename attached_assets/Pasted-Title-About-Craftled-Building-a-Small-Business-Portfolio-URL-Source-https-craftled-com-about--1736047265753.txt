About Craftled
--------------

We're a fully remote company co-founded in 2020 by [Edgaras Benediktavicius](https://edgaras.com/) (Ed), [Isabella Russi Gallon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isabella-russi/) (Isa), and [Tomas Laurinavicius](https://tomaslau.com/) (Tom).

Building a Small Business Portfolio
-----------------------------------

Craftled's philosophy is to stay lean and profitable while building a sustainable and ethical business portfolio.

We started with no-code tools building Content Writing Jobs, a job board for writers, then rebranded to Best Writing, the all-in-one writing marketplace, and rebranded again to Craftled to serve as the holding company for all current and future ventures.

We're inspired by 37signals, Daniel Vassallo's Small Bets, Pieter Levels, saas.group, and other calm, profitable, and sometimes boring business owners.

Craftled Principles
-------------------

We're nerds, artists, and builders at heart. We aim to build an ethical and sustainable business, and we want to do it our way. Here are some of our guiding principles.

### Ship Fast and Often

*   **First do it, then improve it.** It's easy to overthink and imagine big things, but everything starts small and fast.
*   **Stay lean and move fast.** We simplify things and keep costs low. Single Google Sheet for pretty much everything, anyone?
*   **People over quick money.** We play the long game and want to make friends along the way.
*   **Build exciting things.** If it's not fun, why even bother to start your own business?
*   **Ask questions.** We are naturally curious and ask (humans and AI) lots of questions.
*   **No drama.** Be nice. There's a lot going on in the world and we want to build calmly.
