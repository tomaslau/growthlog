Welcome to the checklists :)
----------------------------

Hey everyone 🙂

Thanks for checking out my "Growth Marketing Checklists" resource. I've spent hours and hours creating these checklists on Webflow + writing all the content from scratch.

For those who don't know me, my name is Dan and I'm a growth marketer based in Sydney, Australia 🙂🐨🦘🇦🇺

I'm a passionate marketer + startup enthusiast and I consult/advise a few startups on growth marketing.

One thing I am passionate about is creating content that helps provide value. Normally it's been for other projects and startups, but decided this time to create some resources on my own website. 🙂

These resources will be **updated from time to time** and I'll keep adding to these checklists to help founders and marketers who work for startups, eCommerce businesses and those wanting to grow their indie/side projects.

I hope you enjoy reading this content and get some value out of it. Love to hear your feedback and any recommendations. Enjoy 🙂

1st important notes/considerations: These checklists are meant to be for fun, and hopefully helpful for those checking it out.Everyone will value these checklists differently, especially as I don't know your context - however, regardless of your experience, I hope you'll get some valuable takeaways/things to think about with you projects/business.

2nd key note:  
Some of these checklists are still a work in progress and may be missing some examples (they will added in due time).
